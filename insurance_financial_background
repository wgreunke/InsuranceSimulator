Income
Property/casualty insurers have three types of reserve funds: 
  unearned premium reserves, or pre-claims liability; 
  loss and loss adjustment reserves, or post claims liability; 
  and other.
  
Expences 
Policyholder premiums are an insurer’s main revenue source. Under SAP, when a property/casualty policy is issued, the pre-claim liability or unearned premium is equal to the written premium. (Written premiums are the premiums charged for coverage under policies written regardless of whether they have been collected or “earned.” Each day the policy remains in force, one day of unearned premium is earned, and the unearned premium falls by the amount earned.
